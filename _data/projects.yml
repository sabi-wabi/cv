    Functions as a proactive monitoring tool for safety instrument systems in a production facility in Australia. The underlying model is the use of a statistical method called CuSUM. 
    
    The back-end requirement demands on-the-fly ingesting and transformation of data to evaluate the latest state of those systems. The front-end requirement calls for a UI that spans multiple pages and have interactivity with the back-end to add or modify algorithm parameters. 
    
    The challenge was to design a pipeline that meets the scope and scale with big data. 

    The product moved from concept to MVP in 3 months in a team comprising just myself as the developer and a product owner. 
    
    The pace, output quality and the variety of technology stack applied has earned me the <i> Rising Star in AI </i> individual award in the internal Shell.AI awards competition. This project is also featured in the annual Shell.AI magazine.

    A bespoke web app that utilises Spark Structured Streaming for on-the-fly analytics

    Functions as a live surveillance tool for sand production in a large offshore facility in the Gulf of Mexico. The requirement demands on-the-fly ingesting, processing and calculation with latency of no more than a minute. 

    This was solved using Spark Structured Streaming API to create a pipeline that ingests streaming data, transforms, apply and push to the database continuously.

    The app functions as a tool to generate optimal trading transactions based on a given multitude of boundary conditions. The requirement demands an algorithm that handles many edge cases and captures the complex business logic. 

    This project was shortlisted in the the internal Shell.AI awards competition for a project award but failed to secure a win.
